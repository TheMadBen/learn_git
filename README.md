learn-git repo to learn git

new line for git status --short as well as git commit -a -m "for staging and commiting at once"

if I have created a local repo and want to connect it to github, then I need to:
  1. create the repo in github
  2. get the repo https url
  3. git push --set-upstream https://github.com/TheMadBen/learn_git.git master
    Use clone if there's already an existing Github repo that I want to have
